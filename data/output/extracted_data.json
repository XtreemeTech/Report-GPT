Contractor shall define characteristics of\nthe surface part of the system (cable/fibre, splices, connectors, housings, installation requirements) so that the\nsystem will be fully operational with the requested performances after installation.\nOnly oilfield approved materials shall be used.\nA double ended configuration shall be done.\nEngineering of the system shall be done in the mean time as the production riser itself, particularly at pipe joints and\nduring detail engineering of the termination end of the production riser.\nNo modification on qualified equipment will be allowed for integration of the temperature monitoring. Qualification of\nproduction riser shall be done with all necessary tubing or housing already integrated to the system.\n5.5 Monitoring & calibration\nSince the sensors will be located on the outer surface of the production pipe (non intrusive), contractor shall take into\naccount the inaccuracy of the measurement and correct it, based on a sensitivity analysis done on the fluid\ntemperature, velocity and density parameters.\nWhere active heating of the riser is used, Contractor shall define the time between powering off the heating system,\nand reading of temperature of the inner fluid with the requested accuracy.\n5.6 Banding & tube material\nBanding material used to secure the sensor and or the tubing along the production riser shall be of stainless steel.\nContractor shall insure that material used will be protected against corrosion, and that bi-metallic corrosion will be\navoided.\nAO32-4-013-000-LD-00-SW-001- 03.doc This document is the property of TotalFinaElf E&P Angola and may be neither reproduced nor circulated without the express permission of the owner."

The same requirement applies to intermediate connections (if needed).\nFor steel tube components, a fatigue analysis shall be performed to evaluate the cumulated damage induced during\nthe manufacturing, installation and service life of the production riser.\n5.7 DTS and or Control system\nThe surface unit shall be redundant and have several functions:\nAcquisition and processing of sensors information: Parameters acquired during the calibration process shall be used\nto compensate raw values obtained from the sensors. The surface unit shall transform raw values in engineering\nunits and associate a validity check to each measurement.\nMaintenance of the system: A dedicated engineering console shall be connected to the surface unit, giving a\npassword protected access to calibration and processing parameters for reading and modification. This console shall\nallow direct acquisition, and presentation on a dedicated display, of all the data and presentation of raw values,\nengineering values and associated parameters. Use of the console shall not stop the data to the ICSS, and shall\ngenerate an additional information for the ICSS operator. A built-in test system shall generate alarms for any\nmalfunctioning.\nManagement of the link to the ICSS: Contractor shall provide, from the surface unit to the ICSS, a dual redundant\nserial link. Selection of standard to be applied shall be made with the ICSS contractor and shall be within standard\nprotocols defined by the Foxboro IA series controllers. In its selection, Contractor shall take into account the\nrequested updating time for all the subsea data.\nData management: Only compensated data, in engineering values, shall be transmitted to the ICSS. The system\nshall send, for each riser, to the ICSS the 20 lower and 20 higher temperature points with the location. In addition to\nthese values, the following information shall be made available to the ICSS:\nValidation check of the data\nEngineering console is in use for maintenance purposes\nFailure of the measurement system (one per redundant sensor)\nThe surface unit shall include some data management capabilities:\nLocal storage of raw data, compensated data and engineering values for a period of time equal to or exceeding 15\ndays\nPresentation of the stored values in tables, histograms and edition of trends\nAlarm settings on measurements are not required in the surface units. They shall be set up at the ICSS level.\n6 QUALIFICATION\nThe complete system shall be field-proven or shall withstand extensive qualification testing corresponding to\nfunctions/components that cannot be considered as field-proven. Contractor shall propose a qualification testing\nprogram for Company acceptance according to section 4 of the Flowline riser specification\n7 TESTING\n7.1 FAT\nAO32-4-013-000-LD-00-SW-001- 03.doc This document is the property of TotalFinaElf E&P Angola and may be neither reproduced nor circulated without the express permission of the owner."
