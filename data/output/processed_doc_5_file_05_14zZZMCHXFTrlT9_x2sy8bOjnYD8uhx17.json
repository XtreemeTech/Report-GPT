Firstly, the\nheat transfer through the insulation material alone is determined to establish if\nthere has been material damage during reeling. The second test is to assess the\nactual U-value through the combination of insulation and centralizers.\nObjectives To assess the U-value and the cool down time of the proposed PiP using Aerogel\ninsulated foam\nTo validate calculation model\nProcedure The sample is a piece of the previous one (received from bending trial test) and\nsummary has the length of approximately 12 m. The U-value is measured for the full scale\nPIP system and compared with the calculation and the project requirement.\nAfter stabilization of the temperature profile and measurement of the U-value, a\nshut-down of the heating core is done and the cool down time of the PIP system\nis measured.\nE",
